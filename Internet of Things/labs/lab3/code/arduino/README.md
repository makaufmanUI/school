# Requirements for the Arduino sketch

1. Read the temperature from the HTS221 sensor used in Lab 1 and transmit it to the Pi via the **Temperature characteristic of the Environmental Sensing service** at the Interval specified by the Pi. **DO NOT use the UART service to transmit temperature data.**

2. Receive the sampling interval from the Pi via the Bluetooth LE **Nordic UART service** profile and change the sampling interval of the temperature sensor accordingly.

3. Print the following messages to the serial monitor (at a minimum):

    a) The temperature after every Intervalâ€™s reading.
  
    b) The new Interval every time it is received from the Pi. This message should be printed within one second of the Pi sending the new interval.
